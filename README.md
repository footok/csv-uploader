# Rails CSV uploader 

## Overview
Use rails and Reactjs to build application that allows user to upload a csv file.
After uploading the file, user should be able to see contents of the csv file as a table view.
Also, user can sort the table by clicking column headers, and filtering by name with the filter bar.
